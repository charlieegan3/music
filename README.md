# charlieegan3-music

This is the repo for the projects that manage
[music.charlieegan3.com](https://music.charlieegan3.com).

The project is hosted on Netlify and built using a number of GitHub Actions.

This project is really only for my own use and is kind of hacked together. You
can read all about it in a [blog post
here](https://charlieegan3.com/blog/2018/11/20/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-build-my-own-lastfm).
