# charlieegan3-music

This repo contains the project which manages the data and website at
[music.charlieegan3.com](https://music.charlieegan3.com).

The idea is to give myself music data throughout the year, rather than just as
part of Spotify unwrapped at the end of the year.

The project is desisgned to be registered to a [toolbelt](https://github.com/charlieegan3/toolbelt).
