# charlieegan3-music

This contains the projects which manage the data and website at
[music.charlieegan3.com](https://music.charlieegan3.com).

The site is hosted on Netlify, the data which the site presents is stored in
BigQuery.

This project is only for my own use and is kind of hacked together. You can
read about it in a [blog post
here](https://charlieegan3.com/blog/2018/11/20/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-build-my-own-lastfm).
